                                                               AI enabled waste sorting and recycling optimizer
People are confused about selecting correct bin and that causes environmental pollution and we have poor recycling tips and its time consuming and hygenic.
And there will be high chances of error and they were working in a unsafe condition and it can reduce human efforts. So we proposed the solution using AI.
our prototype is a simple AI based web application and the main features of our prototype is that when an user uploads waste image then AI model identifies the waste object and it gives the category detection 
and it also suggest the dustbin colou and recycling tips have been displayed. And reward points also provided based on correct sorting .
We have created our frontend using html,css,javascript, and created our backend using python.
They have advantages like they are easy to use and beginner friendly and these are scalable for smart cities.They have wide range of applications in households, schools and collegesand etc.
Future enhancement will be provided in this is voice guidance for users aned multi language support.
Our project solves real world waste management problems and it has high potential for future smart city applications.
